    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honey glazed chicken is a delicious dish made by coating chicken in a sweet and sticky glaze made from honey, soy sauce,
    garlic, and other seasonings, and then baking or grilling until the chicken is cooked through and the glaze is
    caramelized. The result is juicy and tender chicken with a golden brown, crispy exterior and a rich, savory-sweet
    flavor. This dish is perfect for a quick and easy weeknight dinner or for entertaining guests.</p>
